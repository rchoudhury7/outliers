All neighbor implementations can be invoked via the main ``NearestNeighbors`` class, which exhibits a similar structure as the corresponding `class <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html>`_ from the `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ package:

.. autoclass:: bufferkdtree.neighbors.NearestNeighbors
